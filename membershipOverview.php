<p>St. George's is nestled within a quiet heritage neighbourhood in Dartmouth 
Nova Scotia.  Membership dues at St. George's are the best in town because
we are run as a not-for-profit organization. </p>

<p>At St. George's you have access to 5 synthetic clay courts with night lighting.
We are open 8 AM to 10:10PM, from May until October. </p>

<p>Members of St. George's love getting together as much as the game itself.
All season long, you'll find a dynamic range of social activities tailored to the 
tennis lover, whether you're a beginner or advanced player.</p>

      <td>Sunday Social</td>
      <td class="description">A great way to meet other members. Every Sunday afternoon from 
      1:30 to 4 PM we 
          meet for mixed doubles play. 
          Players of all skill levels 
          are welcome and we socialize with tea and dessert afterwards.  Balls are provided, but we ask for 
          $1 so that everyone can help
          cover the cost.  People are paired up for doubles play and we switch every half hour. </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Mentor/Protege</td>
      <td  class="description">Throughout the season, we have free workshops on improving
      your game.  Focused around the fundamentals; 
     it could be volleys or lobs or that serve everyone finds so elusive.
     Mentor/Protege is a wonderful way to boost your tennis confidence, 
     and since it happens from 12:30 to 1:30 on Sunday it's also
       a great way to warm up before the Sunday Social.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Wee Weekly</td>
      <td  class="description">For competitive play we have our 
      Wee Weekly tournament every Saturday morning.  A daily draw is made and 
      players compete for the top spot.  If you lose your first match you get
      to play in a consolation draw so everyone that participates is guaranteed
      two matches.  The competition alternates between doubles and singles 
      each week.  Check out the <a href="weeweekly.php">Wee Weekly</a> section for more information.
