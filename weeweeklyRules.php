<br>
<b>I. "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY":</b><br>
-----------------------<br>
<b>0.</b> This document is a  means of formalizing the "WeeWeekly System" for 
present players, new participant or other interested parties. 
More details can be found below [Section II].<br>
<b>1.</b> St. George's[StG's] WeeWeekly[WW] tournaments are meant to provide a
FREE "half-day" competitive environment OPEN to players of varying
skill levels.<br>
<b>2.</b> As with most aspects of St. George's, WW's are organized &amp; run by
VOLUNTEERS.  In general, the guiding principle is: "What's best for
the GROUP [members in general, as well as WW-players] ??"
Try to keep things SIMPLE and NOT WASTE [court] time!<br>
<b>3.</b> Except when weather or other (Provincial/etc.) tournaments prevent
it, Singles &amp; Doubles alternate every Saturday at 9:00am, following
<a href="http://www.stgeorgetennis.ca/calendar.php">http://www.stgeorgetennis.ca/calendar.php</a><br>
To be an "official" WW (with points), there must be a minimum of 6
players for Singles, or 4 teams (8 players) for Doubles, and it
must have been "pre-scheduled" on StG's web page.  Limited to first
32 Singles players, or 48 Doubles players, PRESENT by 9:00am.<br>
<b>4.</b> Rankings (based upon the past 52 weeks' performance) are used to
determine tournament draws as follows:<br>
<b>a. </b>Singles: an "even half" of the top-ranked players are NON-randomly
seeded; the non-seeded players are RANDOMLY evenly distributed.<br>
<b>b.</b> Doubles: the top-ranked HALF of the players are NON-randomly
"seeded"; partners are RANDOMLY drawn from the remaining HALF.<br>
<b>5. </b>Matches are "pro-sets" to 7, with a regular tie-break played at 6-6.
Players are guaranteed 2 matches: play 1 match (win or lose), then
get eliminated upon losing a subsequent match.<br>
<b>6. </b>To facilitate tournament completion by early afternoon (hopefully
usually by 1 or 2 pm), "longer" (more competitive) matches are
played first, with preference given to "Winners side" matches, then
equally "deep" Consolations matches).  Since 80 to 100% of StG's
courts are used for WW's, WW-players should "reasonably" allow other
members use of "open" (NOT needed for tournament matches) courts.<br>
<b>7. </b>Points (for ranking/seeding purposes) are determined based upon
tournament "results" &amp; participation.<br>
<b>8.</b> Disputes/problems/interpretations/etc. should first be attempted to
be resolved QUICKLY among players [see #2. above].  In the interest
of expediency, the "Tournament Director" shall have final authority
in WW-related matters.  The "Duty Host" is [unless directed otherwise
by the StG's "Board"] limited to CLEARLY recording names of players
seeking to participate in that morning's WW.<br>
<b>9. </b>Please realize that WW's are a very good HUMAN enterprise/
undertaking that can NEVER be "perfect".  Over the years, WW's have
been "tweaked" to result in a GREAT activity.
Suggestions for improvement (especially after checking if covered
below) ARE welcome and given serious consideration.</p>

<b>II. DETAILED WEE-WEEKLY GUIDELINES/"RULES":</b><br>
-------------------------------------------</p>

<p align="left">
<b>0. VERY DETAILED</b><br>
explanations + rationale for EVERYTHING WeeWeekly-
related (that could be thought up during initial creation of this
document) follow.<br>
a. Topic numbering for this Section II. follows above Section I.<br>
b. Some ABBREVIATIONS [in case confusion later/below]:
PD = [Ranking] Points Distributor/Determiner [Gerry V. until 2009;
mainly PL in 2010] updates results then posts them online
(usually by Wednesday).
PL = Pat Lee  [author of most of this document based on his
experiences: 2003-10 WW player; 2009-10 WW TD; 2010 WW PD;
plus moderate TNS tournament experience]
StG's = St. George's Lawn Tennis Club  [StGeorgeTennis.ca]
TD = Tournament Director [mainly PL for 2009-2010] creates draw
then decide match ordering.<br>
TNS = TennisNovaScotia.ca  [formerly NSTA]<br>
WW = StG's WeeWeekly [tournament system]<br>
WW's = WeeWeeklies (plural)<br>
WWd = WW Doubles<br>
WWs = WW Singles</p>

<p align="left">
<b>1. a. BRIEF HISTORY:</b>  [based on various sources]<br>
Krys Dlutek started the WeeWeekly tournaments in 1990.  They have
been organized and run by WW participants (players) and/or other
VOLUNTEERS/staff over the years.  Gerry Vrbensky, the "soul" of
StG's website, has diligently maintained rankings and other
essential WW aspects over the years.  Two decades after its
"birth", WW's have grown significantly in participation: approx.
50% more players in 2010 than in 2009.  This has resulted in many
questions/suggestions/etc. which this document [created initially
by PL as a hopefully sufficiently detailed "manual"/guide to
running "optimally efficient streamlined" WW's] hopes to address.<br>
<b>b. TOURNAMENT:</b><br>
WW's ARE tennis "tournaments" (as contrasted with "Socials") with
specific rules/etc. above, beyond, and sometimes different than
those of Tennis Canada [which are a "foundation" for WW rules]:
<a href="http://www.TennisCanada.com/Pub/DisplayPage.aspx?PageID=180">http://www.TennisCanada.com/Pub/DisplayPage.aspx?PageID=180</a>
Personal enjoyment of competition will vary...<br>
<b>c. FREE:</b><br>
Since there is NO ENTRY FEE for this weekly club tournament,
players are expected to provide their own tennis balls.  Players
SHOULD be able to decide amongst themselves whose/which balls are
acceptable for use.  One approach has been that players may each
bring/buy a NEW (unopened) can of balls, with the match loser
keeping the "just used" match balls, and the winner advancing with
the UNOPENED can.<br>
<b>d. DURATION &amp; WAITING:</b><br>
WW's are an "elimination tournament" in which MOST participants
should be done by around noon, if not earlier.  All players are
guaranteed two matches.  Regardless of what happens in the first
match, when a player loses a subsequent match, they are out of the
tournament.  "Better" players will advance "deeper" into the
tournament draw and will play more matches.
Participants will, out of necessity, have to "take turns" and
share the limited number of tennis courts.  When there are more
participants, the wait time is generally increased, although
STEPS [see below] are taken to minimize this for all!<br>
<b>e. OPEN:</b><br>
WW's are OPEN to ANY StG's "member" who abides by
http://www.stgeorgetennis.ca/rules.php
This includes Temporary members and legal Guests.
However, WW's are NOT meant to be "Saturday morning day-care".<br>
<b>f. SKILL LEVEL:</b><br>
Player skills will vary from beginner to advanced.
Competitive/ranked/"promising" juniors are welcome.
Although it ranges depending upon the year, the skill level of
WW-players roughly approximates players in TNS's MEN's "Class A"
to "weak Open" (or Masters 45+).  Based on
http://www.usta.com/Play-Tennis/USTA-League/Information/1237_NTRP/
NTRP Men's ratings of 2.5 to 4.5 (with a 0.5 margin of "error"...)</p>

<p align="left">
<b>2. a. VOLUNTEERS:</b><br>
Remember that WW's are a StG's activity run by players for other
players -- PLEASE feel free to learn/contribute/etc.!  The more
players who take an interest in learning to keep things running
smoothly, the better it will be for ALL!<br>
<b>b. GUIDING PRINCIPLE:</b><br>
When a situation NOT covered by these "rules" arises, handling it
in a manner that benefits the "majority", be it WW-players or
StG's members in general, seems a wise guideline...
REMEMBER: "WW-players" *ARE* StG's "members"!!
(In general, "majority rules" should work.)</p>

<p align="left">
<b>3. a. SCHEDULE:</b><br>
WWs alternate every Saturday morning with WWd, according to
http://www.stgeorgetennis.ca/calendar.php
If one week is canceled (usually "rained out"), the next week
does NOT change to replace the missed WW.<br>
<b>b. START TIME (&amp; RESERVED SPOTS):</b><br>
ALL players are expected to be PRESENT by 9:00am which is the WW
registration "cutoff time", except when courts are not yet
playable.  A Duty Host is usually present by 8:30am which is the
earliest "sign-up" time to take names by phone as a COURTESY;
VoiceMail can be missed.  Priority is given to the FIRST 32
players for Singles and 48 players for Doubles present by 9:00am
when the Draw is made.  Calling in and then failing to show is a
SERIOUS OFFENSE resulting in no WW-playing privileges for 1 year.
NOTE: calling in does NOT guarantee a "reserved spot", since
potentially many players COULD be already PRESENT and waiting.<br>
<b>c. NUMBER OF PLAYERS: </b> <br>   
Singles = 6 to 32<br>
Doubles = 8 to 48<br>
In cases of insufficient players, that WW is officially CANCELED.
but, players may still organize and play amongst themselves!<br>
<b>d. RAIN/DELAY POLICY:</b><br>
CALL the club to check on the status of courts!
In fairness to all StG's members (including WW-players), if the
courts are not playable (i.e., still too wet) by 11:00am, then
that week's WW will be considered "rained out" (i.e., canceled).
In cases of impending inclement weather, a vote among players
present can be used to possibly abbreviate matches.
Tournaments unable to reach (due to weather/etc.) the "final four"
stage (4 Main draw Singles semi-finalists, or 2 Main draw Doubles
teams) shall be deemed "washed out" and no points awarded.
If play is halted with only 4 or less Main draw participants
remaining, the players, along with the TD, SHOULD be able to
decide upon later completion or "splitting the points"...</p>

<p align="left">
<b>4. a. RANKINGS:</b><br>
The most current WW rankings [generally updated by Wednesday
following each Saturday's WW] as well as the "system" of points
distribution and rankings calculations can be found at
<a href="http://www.stgeorgetennis.ca/weeweekly.php">http://www.stgeorgetennis.ca/weeweekly.php</a>.
Seedings are based upon rankings which are based upon PERFORMANCE
&amp; PARTICIPATION in WW's.  The WW tradition of seeding based solely
on WW-rankings is COMPLETELY UNBIASED.  The TD's copy of the
rankings should be current and will be used for seeding.<br>
<b>b. SEEDING &amp; DRAWS:</b><br>
WWs: seed (# of players)/2, rounding 0.5 such that an EVEN # [for
"balance"] results.  For example:<br>
22 players: 22/2 = 11.0 --&gt; seed top 11 players<br>
23 players: 23/2 = 11.5 --&gt; seed top 12 players<br>
24 players: 24/2 = 12.0 --&gt; seed top 12 players<br>
25 players: 25/2 = 12.5 --&gt; seed top 12 players<br>
26 players: 26/2 = 13.0 --&gt; seed top 13 players<br>
27 players: 27/2 = 13.5 --&gt; seed top 14 players<br>
Note: the seeding of 50% (as contrasted with the usual 25%)<br>
of the players, along with the NON-random placement of
the "seeds", is simply a "WW tradition" which
facilitates simple quick accurate draws.</p>

<p align="left">
Example draw set-up for 9 players (A-I):
Rank  Name  Seed<br>
1    A     #1<br>
3    B     #2<br>
6    C     #3<br>
10    D     #4  [Note:  9/2 = 4.5 --&gt; seed top 4 players]<br>
...  ...   ...<br>
E,F,G,H,I     [lower ranks irrelevant since randomized]</p>

<p align="left">
R16    QF    SF    F     W    R16 = "round of 16"<br>
<img border="0" src="images/dr16.jpg" width="466" height="456"></p>

<p align="left">
BYE = a temporary advancement in the main ("winner's side")
draw [given to "highest seeds"]; but, player moves to
consolations side (LEFT) if loses 1st match (a seed
is said to have been "upset").<br>
<br>
&nbsp;Drawsheet size: 16
- (# of players): 9<br>----<br>
7 BYEs - 4[to seeds] = 3 BYEs left<br>
Remaining BYEs are evenly "spread out" by simply placing
them where "seeds" #5 to 7 would be -- this actually
serves to INCREASE the competition for "top seeds"!
[in this case, 1 QF is NOT "automatic" and the #1 seed
must face(play) a "warmed up" match winner].
THEN randomly place remaining 5 players in 5 positions.
For randomizing, there are 16 pre-made "cards" with the
"WW Clipboard" [which also has pre-numbered drawsheets].
If over 32 players, then "strips of paper" with numbers
on them can be drawn...</p>

<p align="left">
NOTICE PATTERN: if above "outline" were used for 16+
players, and if seeds win as "expected",
SF's sum to 5, QF's to 9, [R16 to 17,...]</p>

<p align="left">
Consolation matches are to the LEFT, and will often include
many "holes" cause by BYEs and DEFAULTs.  Consolation-side
players must often "wait" to see if a seed is "upset"
before advancing early on the LEFT side...</p>

<p align="left">
WWd: There MUST be an EVEN number of players.  Then the above
"seeding pattern" is used to spread out the teams.
Non-seeded players then get partnered with the seeds.  BYEs
are "automatic" based upon the resulting draw.
ODD # of WWd-players: if waiting until 9:10am for an "extra
body" is unsuccessful, then either 1 player sits out (LAST
to ARRIVE or a "volunteer"), or perhaps the "Duty Host" can
be encouraged to "fill in"...<br>
"TEAM PRACTICE": in the event that a NON-RANDOM (pre-set)
"team" wishes to play a WWd, in order to preserve the
integrity of the ranking system, such a team will be "fed"
into the Consolation side at the TD's discretion (perhaps
to a team benefiting from more byes/defaults?).</p>

<p align="left">
A more LEGIBLE (printed names are easier to read) drawsheet makes
the PD's task easier...</p>

<p align="left">
<b>5. a. SCORING:</b><br>
Please see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_score
for an introduction to tennis scoring.
WW "matches" consist of SINGLE "pro-sets" that are played to 7
games (as opposed to the usual set which generally goes to 6).
So, at 6-0, at least 1 more game needs to be won.
However, at 6-6 (tied at 6 games each), a "standard" tie-break
to "7-points" is played in which the first player to reach 7
points, leading by 2, is the winner.<br>
<b>b. NO-AD:</b><br>
In cases of more than 24 WWs players or 37 WWd players, "No-Ad"
scoring is used and MUST BE ENFORCED!
No-ad scoring means that at "deuce"(40-40), the RECEIVER chooses
which side to receive the serve, with the winner of that point
winning the game.<br>
<b>c. TWO MATCHES &amp; WARM-UP:</b><br>
WW's are NOT "double-elimination" where one must LOSE TWO MATCHES
to be eliminated; 2 matches are "guaranteed" (except in the rare
case where all subsequent opponents elect to default themselves).
Please be courteous to other waiting players/members and limit
pre-match warm-ups to 5 minutes.  Players are encouraged to
arrive well before 9am to "warm-up".<br>
<b>d. SCORES:</b><br>
Although it is generally considered the WINNER's responsibility
to report match results/scores, it is helpful if SOMEONE can
report results (including tie-break scores) ASAP.<br>
<b>e. DEFAULTS:</b><br>
Players SHOULD arrange to be and stay at the courts until
approximately 12 noon if they choose to participate.  In fairness
and as a courtesy to other WAITING players, when unable to play a
match on time, it is better to default oneself ASAP rather than
hold up the tournament!  PLEASE let the TD know ASAP, or ensure
that your intentions are CLEARLY indicated on the draw sheet, when
intending to default.  Defaults in Doubles HURT YOUR PARTNER so
please try to avoid them!  Substitutions are not allowed.
In Singles, defaults are common and acceptable in the consolations
(generally from "weaker" players who quickly lose their first
match then do not wish to wait around for their next match).
For MAIN DRAW matches, PLEASE DO NOT "LET" THE WEAKER PLAYER
WIN/ADVANCE!  For points/ranking, it is better (although "frowned
upon) to win your match, THEN elect to default (perhaps due to
injury/etc.) upon reporting the score.  Allowing a "weaker" player
to advance &amp; then get "undeserved points" only serves to reduce
the integrity of the rankings.
If unable to commit to playing until approx. 12 noon, it is better
to NOT sign-up to play.</p>

<p align="left">
<b>6. a. COMPLETION TIME:</b><br>
As this is a TOURNAMENT with matches, the precise ending time
can NOT be predicted.  However, most players are eliminated by
"noon", which is also the approx. time that some courts may become
"free".  Doubles usually ends around 1pm, Singles around 2-3pm.<br>
b. LONG MATCHES FIRST:<br>
From experience, proper choice of the first 4-5 matches can
DRASTICALLY reduce tournament completion time.  Also, hopefully
players can reach QF/SF/F approx. "together".<br>
<b>c. MAIN DRAW PRIORITY:</b><br>
The "Main Draw", "winner's side", is more important than the
the "Consolations", "loser's side", and as such is reflected in
the points awarded.  Thus, for equally "deep" matches, when courts
are still limited, the "winner's side" matches have priority.
For example, if there are 28 Singles players [such large draws
are when such prioritizations along with "long matches first" &amp;
"No-Ad" scoring are essential], then the "longest" 5 matches
play 1st (at around 9:15am -- it takes time after 9:00am to
create a draw).  By 10:15am, the 2nd group of 5 should hopefully
start (again, with potentially "long" matches playing earlier).
By 11am, most of the FIRST ROUND (1R) matches will be completed.
While some 1R matches are finishing, "Winner's side" "Round of
16" matches can commence (again with "longer" matches sooner).
Towards the last few Round-of-16 matches (around "noon"), courts
will free up for Consolations Round-of-16 to begin.  However,
many players will have defaulted themselves rather than wait, so
there may not be too many such matches to play.  As Consolations
Round-of-16 completes, Main draw Quarter-finals matches can
start (again with priority over Consolations QF's, when courts
are still busy).  Of course, rather than leave a court "idle",
ANY available match (even a Consolations match "deeper" than the
Main Draw) should go on an unused court.<br>
Towards the end of the tournament, one "half" ("top" or "bottom")
often gets "ahead" and must wait for others to "catch up".  In
such cases, players may elect to "rest"/wait (when such actions
will NOT delay overall tournament completion) and "free up" courts
for Consolation matches.<br>
<b>d. OPEN COURTS:</b><br>
Since WW's as a "scheduled priority" utilize all 5 courts (WWs)
or Courts #1-4 (WWd) virtually every Saturday morning, and
sometimes later into the afternoon depending on participation
numbers &amp; weather conditions, DO NOT WASTE COURT TIME!
Some courts should become "open" [no longer needed for WW
tournament matches] around "noon" and should be "shared" in the
following SUGGESTED order:<br>
1. WW tournament matches  [by definition, not really "open"]<br>
2. Non WW-players seeking a court [this allows them to possibly
see the fun/skill level of WW-players!]<br>
3. Eliminated (that day) WW-players<br>
4. WW-players still in tournament CANNOT book a court while
STILL *IN* the draw!
Of course if eliminated after 2 doubles matches and you wish to
utilize Court #5 and those players have already played an hour,
then feel free to "bump" them using normal booking procedures...</p>

<p align="left">
<b>7. a. POINTS</b> (for ranking/seeding purposes):<br>
If the PD is NOT present at the WW, then the TD should get the
drawsheet (or a scanned copy) to the PD by Monday or ASAP.
Points are assigned to WW participants by the PD based upon their
accomplishments after each WW tournament -- the further one
advances in a tournament draw (generally by successfully winning
more "matches"), the more points:<br>
S I N G L E S       TOURNAMENT       D O U B L E S<br>
Main Consolation     Draw / Round     Main Consolation<br>
---- -----------    --------------    ---- -----------<br>
45      12             Winner         30      12<br>
30       8            Finalist        20       8<br>
20       5           Semi-Finals      14       5<br>
14       3         Quarter-Finals     10       3<br>
10       2           Round-of-16       7       2<br>
Note that points are awarded to players based upon where in the
draw they are eliminated (or choose to default themselves).
If no ATTEMPT is made to play a subsequent match, extra points are
NOT awarded for defaults/byes.  [default = match in which 1 player
/team fails to participate; bye = there is NO player/team to play
a specific match]<br>
b. RANKING FORMULA:<br>
Players are ranked (with a separate ranking maintained for
Singles and Doubles[team play]) in descending order based on the
number of "Ranking Points" they have, calculated as follows based
on the past 52 weeks (= 1 year = 12 months):</p>

<p align="left">
Tm = number of WWs or WWd tournaments played in the past year
TTL_Pts = total points based on adding up accumulated WW points<br>
CD = Current Division Factor = (Tm * 0.5) + 1.5<br>
[ * = multiplication ]<br>
RnkPts = Ranking Points = TTL_Pts / CD   [ / = division ]</p>

<p align="left">
Although rankings are based upon performance during the past 52
weeks, only the CURRENT year's results are used for final year-end
"awards" (e.g., names on Clubhouse plaques).
Note also that from a strict mathematically correct standpoint,
"Ranking Points" ONLY equals "Average Points" [= "mean"] for<br>
EXACTLY Tm=3.</p>

<p align="left">
<b>8. a. DISPUTES/ETC.:</b><br>
Since court time is "precious", and WW's are a tournament run BY
players FOR players, players should try to QUICKLY resolve
problems/etc. among themselves (maybe with TD "guidance"/advice).
The TD will handle "unresolved problems" in a decisive &amp; final
manner.
Unsatisfied members may "escalate" complaints [see below].<br>
<b>b. DUTY HOSTS:</b><br>
Unless given addition "duties" by the StG's "Board", Duty Hosts
are asked simply to LEGIBLY record the names (first and at least
initial of last name) of ALL players seeking to play (either
already present at StG's or "called in").
In addition, a Duty Host *MAY* sometimes help prevent member
disappointment when an ODD # of players at a WWd.</p>

<p align="left">

<p align="left">

<b>III. "WEE WEEKLY FAQ":</b><br>
----------------------<br>
<b>Q: What's this FAQ?</b><br>
A: This is a collection of questions/complaints/comments/suggestions/
concerns/musings/etc. that COULD BE "frequently asked", or perhaps
just imagined/muttered.</p>

<p align="left">
<b>Q: Why has PL gone into so much &quot;nauseating&quot; detail here?</b><br>
A: Since 2009, PL has been trying to prevent a few complainers from
ruining something which the "silent majority" seems to quietly enjoy.
This is in response a few "complaints"/etc. made about the WW's...
Also, others can take over the running of WW's when PL is unavailable
yet maintain consistency (with points/etc.).<br>
NOTE: this document in NOT meant to discourage players or make
WW's less enjoyable!  It is a response to a "few people" (with
limited or no WW experience, who may have either not known about
or understood the StG's website) whose questions/complaints/etc.
were directed to others without WW experience (&amp;/or maybe also had
difficulty understanding/accessing the StG's website), and as a
means of formalizing the "WW System" for future players &amp;/or new
participants.
Believe it or not, this is PL's idea of SIMPLICITY!</p>

<p align="left">
<b>Q: I like to have long breaks (hours to rest/recover/etc.) between
matches.</b><br>
A: Either lose 1st match then long wait until 1st consolations match,
or play TNS tournaments (where matches are spread out over DAYs...)</p>

<p align="left">
<b>Q: PL wins too often and easily!  The draw must be "rigged"!</b><br>
A: Please feel free to learn &amp; participate in the making of these
"half random" draws [since half seeded = "half fixed"].</p>

<p align="left">
<b>Q: I keep losing before I get to play anyone "good".</b><br>
A: Practice to get better...YouTube.com  has MANY fine FREE
instructional videos!</p>

<p align="left">
Q: I only want to play against "hard hitting" players.
PL wins too easily and makes me play bad!<br>
A: Roger Federer's slice backhand is NOT considered a "power shot"!
Andy Murray wins using variety.</p>

<p align="left">
<b>Q: I only want to play against "advanced" players.
I get bored playing "weak players".</b><br>
A: For 2010, there was only one(1) StG's member who was capable of<br>
EASILY winning every WWs.  Even this "Open Class" player faced weaker<br>
opponents in many TNS tournaments (winning one final 6-0,6-0).<br>
There were an additional 2 other StG's members who, based on TNS<br>
results, were capable of winning SOME WWs tournaments in 2010.<br>
WW's always include players who also have had some (limited)<br>
success competing at a provincial level.<br>
["Elitism" already failed with 2010's attempted "Advanced Doubles"]</p>

<b>Q: PL is a dictator and ignores my suggestions, especially when
when trying to quickly create a draw with integrity while 20+
players are waiting to start!
</b><br>
A: Yes.
Please feel free to discuss matters with the TD/others during the
quiet "waiting for matches to finish" time, and/or email your
concerns to WeeWeekly@StGeorgeTennis.ca</p>

<b>Q: I don't have fun at WW's!  I don't like the VOLUNTEERS running them!</b><br>
A: As with most aspects of St. George's, WW's are organized &amp; run by
VOLUNTEERS; in this case, WW's are run BY more experienced fellow
players FOR other players -- please feel free to learn then help out!
As a COMPETITIVE tournaments, "fun" can NOT be guaranteed as
individual responses to losing can vary unpredictably.</p>

<p align="left">
<b>Q: Can I pay some $ at WW's?  The prizes "suck"!</b><br>
A: Prizes are proportional to entry fees.
Currently, no fees are taken in, either for purchase of balls or for
"prizes"...
Tips for the TD/PD are appreciated, but, will NOT result in
favoritism!  </p>

<p align="left">
<b>Q: Why can't I call in days/weeks ahead of time and "book" my place?</b><br>
A: A "first come, first served" system (which is StG's "tradition")
simplifies things while maximizing fairness to MOST (maybe not
ALL), without allowing "early bookings" (with potential "no shows"
common to pre-booked FREE events) RUINing the Majority's "fun"!</p>

<p align="left">
<b>Q: Why is there a limit to the number of players who can play?</b><br>
A: WW's are intended to be a "half-day" QUICK tournament.  More players
takes longer, unless matches are shortened (which MOST players
generally OPPOSE!).  The "minimum" number of players is meant to
promote validity of the rankings.<br>
In 2010 (with 85 unique WW-players), the most players was 29 for
WWs, 30 for WWd.  Doubles is limited to 24 teams due to 20% less
courts plus generally longer match times due to coordination of
more people and more "parity" (random partners --&gt; closer scores).
In cases of insufficient players, that WW is officially CANCELED,
but, players may still organize and play amongst themselves!
If WW's grow further still, serious considerations will be needed
to perhaps significantly change some aspects, such as limits,
scoring, &amp;/or perhaps having a preliminary "B draw" Saturday
morning, that "feeds" into a stronger Sunday morning "A Draw"...
[a "radical" 2009 idea then impractical due to much smaller draws]</p>

<p align="left">
<b>Q: Why wasn't I seeded?  I can beat #__ !!</b><br>
A: Rather than use "judgment" (which frequently differs among players/
professionals), "strong" players can "prove" that they "deserve" a
high[er] seeding by simply WINNING MORE WW MATCHES to improve their
ranking (rather than "complaining about being under-seeded"!)
While NO "seeding" system can EVER be perfect (see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open#Records ), the WW's
can NOT be accused of "favoritism".  (BTW, in 2008, the most
competitively skilled club member StG's has had in MANY years
simply [easily] won enough WWs tournaments to claim #1...).</p>

<p align="left">
<b>Q: What is "seeding"?  Why is the #1 seed considered "higher" than #2?</b><br>
A: This is a terminology/usage convention:  although the number "1" is
smaller than "2", a "#1" ranking is considered "higher" than "#2";
seeding is a way of separating "highly ranked" players so that they
("seeds") do not play against each other until later in the draw.</p>

<p align="left">
<b>Q: Why isn't there a PRECISE ending time for WW's?</b><br>
A: In contrast to "Social" events that can play for a set time [which
can NOT work in a tournament setting due to "stalling"], the precise
ending time can NOT be predicted (cf., Wimbledon 2010).</p>

<p align="left">
<b>Q: Why are "longer" matches given court priority?</b><br>
A: The rationale for the TD starting "longer" (more competitive
[based upon TD's/others' experience/advice]) matches first is:
Essentially, if one wanted to "drag out" (lengthen) an activity
(tournament/project/etc.) as for as long possible, one can
imagine trying to schedule the lengthiest activities (upon which
LATER activities are DEPENDENT) as late as possible.  So, by
doing LONG DEPENDENT activities FIRST, the potential for the
"worst case scenario" is minimized!  Basically, try to avoid
having LONG matches "hold up" the entire tournament...
For more info, see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_path_method
From experience, proper choice of the first 4-5 matches (e.g.,
having 2 "beginners" [who at least know how to keep track of
tennis scores] (or 2 "pushers" [defensive players who prefer to
patiently wait for an unforced error from their opponent]) play
each other ASAP can (along with priority given to Main draw
matches) DRASTICALLY (1-2 hrs) reduce tournament completion time.
Also, hopefully players can reach QF/SF/F approx. "together".</p>

<p align="left">
<b>Q: Why is there sometimes such a long wait between matches?</b><br>
A: In general, more players than courts results in waiting.
Higher seeded players usually get 1R byes and often wait must 1-2
hours before playing their first match!  Players who play almost
immediately after the draw is made but lose their first match, can
anticipate waiting 1-2 hrs for their 1st "Consolations" match to
begin (assuming relatively large numbers of players, "winner's side"
matches are given priority).  Also, defaults can sometimes further
increase wait time.</p>

<p align="left">
<b>Q: Can I change the WW point system?</b><br>
A: The above points distribution has been successfully used for the
WW's for MANY YEARS and there do NOT seem to be any compelling
reasons for change.</p>

<p align="left">
<b>Q: Tell me more about the ranking system.</b><br>
A: Professional tennis seems to use a MORE COMPLEX system that
includes some notion of "best n of m results".
This current WW divisor system yields CD's of (2,2.5,3,3.5,4,...)
which has been shown to DRAMATICALLY improve the "realism" of
player ranking as compared with the pre-2010 system (similar to
old TNS's) with divisors of (3,3,3,4,4.5,...).  The old CD's
encouraged "sitting on points" [protecting one's point average by
only playing 3 WW's, especially in Doubles where LUCK-OF-THE-DRAW
often played a large role!], while the new (2010-) CD system more
accurately ranks infrequent strong players yet rewards
participation.</p>

<p align="left">
<b>Q: Why should the TD help resolve disputes/etc.?</b><br>
A: Since the TD has enough experience/etc. to be capable of creating
a proper draw then setting out match order, the TD SHOULD also be
"wise" enough to handle "problems" (with assistance from others if
absolutely needed...) in a DECISIVE (quick &amp; final) manner.  This
should help avoid "gridlock" caused by a single "unhappy" player.</p>

<p align="left">
<b>Q: Why are WW's so "awesome"??</b><br>
A: For any players who have PAID $$ to then endure protracted waits
(from rain delays, long matches, etc.) at TNS or other tennis
tournaments, the experience of WW's *SHOULD* be a dramatic
improvement!!  This may be reflected by the observation that WW's
have FAR MORE PARTICIPANTS than most TNS tournaments!
Any changes to WW's are likely to be incremental/small and must be
well thought out so as not to "hurt" something already GREAT!
I.e, don't "break" something VERY good while trying to "fix" it!
Thus, ANY changes [suggestions ARE welcome] are UNLIKELY to be a
potential improvement, and change is likely to be SLOW!</p>
